# Early Christian Lineage
{% include mermaid.html %}

This project is a **visual and textual map of early Christian influencers** from the 1st to 6th centuries.  
It traces the teacher–student relationships, church communities, and key teachings that shaped the early church.

## What you’ll find here
- **Lineage Chart** – a Mermaid diagram showing who taught whom and how the great church centers (Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Carthage, Cappadocia, etc.) developed.
- **Profiles of People** – concise notes on Apostles, Apostolic Fathers, Apologists, Ante-Nicene, Nicene, and Post-Nicene Fathers. Each profile includes:
    - Lifespan (approximate dates)
    - Teachers and students
    - Regions where they taught
    - Key themes and teachings
    - Conversion story (if known)
    - Emphasis on church unity (if present)
- **Profiles of Churches** – background on the early Christian communities that became hubs of theology and leadership.

## Explore
- [View the Lineage Chart](charts/lineage.md)
- [Browse People Profiles](people/)
- [Browse Church Profiles](churches/)

## How it works
- Scripture is treated as **certain**.
- Widely accepted traditions are included.
- Disputed or evenly debated information is noted as such.
- The focus is on **teachers, writers, and church builders** rather than every name in the historical record.
